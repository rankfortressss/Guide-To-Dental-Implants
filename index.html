                <h2 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;font-size: 30px;color: #000000;">What Happens When You Donâ€™t Get Your Missing Teeth Replaced?</h2>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Ignore your missing teeth now, and you'll face the consequences later. Don't wait for it to happen: Here's why you should visit your dentist about it ASAP.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Regular Checkups</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Adults between the ages of 20 and 64 have an average of 25.5 remaining teeth. That means many people are missing teeth, and some have none left.<br>
                    <br>Is that a problem? <br>
                    <br>Well, it can be. Your teeth play several essential roles in your health and appearance. It's best to replace missing teeth if you can. <br>
                    <br>Read on to learn all about the importance of having a qualified dentist replace those missing teeth.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Your Jaw Needs Support</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Did you know that your teeth support the integrity of your jaw? <br>
                <br>The roots of your teeth are embedded in the jawbone, providing stimulation to keep the bone strong and healthy. When you bite or chew on something, it strengthens the jaw bone surrounding each tooth. Without a tooth to apply pressure over the jawbone, it can weaken and deteriorate. <br>
                <br>This is called bone resorption. <br>
                <br>When you replace your missing teeth with dental implants, the implants act as artificial tooth roots. Your jaw responds to them precisely as it would a natural tooth. <br>Over time, the implants wills strengthen your jaw and reverse (or prevent) the problems associated with bone resorption. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Preserving Overall Oral Health</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Losing a tooth, whether an extracted tooth or lost due to a trauma event, puts the surrounding teeth at risk. Your oral health can suffer, even if you're good at caring for yourself. <br>
                <br>Gaps left by missing teeth can disrupt the alignment of the surrounding teeth, causing them to shift or tilt. This can lead to bite problems, tooth misalignment, and problems with proper oral hygiene. <br>
                <br>If you're missing teeth, your surrounding teeth may also be at a greater risk of breaking. They don't have the support of the other teeth protecting them, and one particular hard bite could cause problems. In other words, losing one tooth could lead to losing more if you're not careful. <br>
                <br>By having a dentist fill the gaps with prosthetic teeth, you can preserve the alignment and stability of your remaining teeth, making cleaning them more manageable and preventing oral health issues like tooth decay and gum disease.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Preserving Your Ability to Eat and Speak</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Your teeth are instrumental in your ability to eat and speak! <br>
                <br>You don't notice how important your teeth are until they're no longer there. Your speech can change dramatically even after losing only a few teeth; of course, your ability to bite and chew will change if you lose teeth. <br>
                <br>Missing teeth can make it difficult to chew certain foods correctly, leading to dietary limitations. Sure, you can stick to a soft foods diet if you choose, but you may struggle with your nutrition. You need to ensure you're eating enough fiber and protein, which can be a challenge if you struggle to chew. <br>
                <br>As we mentioned, losing teeth can also affect your speaking ability. While your teeth aren't the most critical factor in speech, they play a part. <br>
                <br>Replacing missing teeth with functional prosthetic teeth, such as dental implants, can restore your ability to chew and speak as well as you could with your natural teeth.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Supporting Your Facial Structure</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Have you ever seen someone without any teeth at all? They seem to have a sunken appearance to their face, right? <br>
                <br>This is because your teeth play a prominent role in determining your facial structure. They "fill out" your face, so to speak, and without them, you may notice significant facial changes. <br>
                <br>Missing teeth can lead to sagging and an older appearance, even if you're still young. We associate that appearance with age because older adults are more likely to be missing teeth. <br>
                <br>Dental prosthetics, especially those that replace multiple missing teeth, can help support the facial structure, maintain proper lip and cheek support, and prevent the sunken-in appearance associated with tooth loss. <br>
                <br>Looking "better" is subjective, but you'll retain your original appearance.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Improved Self-Esteem</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Often, the most important benefit of replacing missing teeth is gaining more self-esteem. <br>
                <br>Many people feel self-conscious about their missing teeth, even if their remaining teeth are healthy. If this sounds familiar, it makes sense to replace your missing teeth with prosthetics. <br>
                <br>You deserve to have a smile you love to show off. It's not vain to want to like your appearance. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">What Are Your Options for Missing Teeth?</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Do you want to know how to fix your smile? What are your options for a missing tooth (or multiple missing teeth) anyway? <br>
                <br>Dentures, dental bridges, and dental implants are your main options. <br>
                <br>Dentures are suitable for people with multiple missing or no teeth at all. They can be fixed or removable. They can sometimes be uncomfortable, but most people adjust well.Bridges are suitable for people with one missing tooth between several healthy teeth. The bridge fills the gap between the healthy teeth to restore the smile. <br>
                <br>Dental implants are suitable for anyone who's missing any teeth at all. Whether it's one tooth or a whole smile, the implants act as artificial tooth roots, and the crowns on top act as your teeth. They look and feel natural. <br>
                <br>Your dentist can help you decide which option is right for you.  </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">It's Time to Fix Your Smile</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">A few missing teeth can have serious consequences, but don't worry. There are ways to replace your teeth and preserve your smile. You can protect your jaw, maintain oral health, and improve your appearance! <br>
